# CGT_365_review

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

Meet Goals: I think we meet our goals in this game. At the beginning of this course we wanted to develop some soul-like game and I think from our demo we have accomplished this goal. Although there's still lots of things that can be improved, I think what the game looks for now is satisfying for me. 

Project Matches Description: We haven't changed the genre or gameplay. The game is exactly what we want as we planned at the beginning of this course. Because our progress are little faster than expected, we were planning to add some new bosses but soon abort this idea since the presentation date was coming.
